# Hastebin Client (in Go)

Yet another CLI for hastebin, this one written in Go. It is intended to be used similarly to the original
[haste client](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-client), but also be able to get/read hastes.\
As an added bonus, there's also cross-platform support without dependencies on other tools.

It also supports client certificates for mTLS for some reason.

## Installation

Navigate to the latest [release](https://github.com/jagoe/haste-client-go/releases) and download the client for your OS and architecture.

## Usage

### Creating a haste

Without any arguments, `haste` reads from the STDIN:

```bash
cat file | haste
```

Provided with a file argument, `haste` will create a haste from the contents of that file and return the URL pointing to it:

```bash
url=$(haste file) # equivalent to cat file | haste
echo $url         # e.g. https://hastebin.com/ogoquyocaq
```

### Reading a haste

`haste` can read a haste using the `get` command:

```bash
haste get <key>           # prints the haste contents to STDOUT
haste get <key> -o ./file # prints the haste contents to ./file
```

### Help

For more detailed information on how `haste` can be used, use `haste --help` or look here:

## Build

_Requires [`golang 1.15+`](https://golang.org/doc/install)._

If there is no release for your OS and architecture or if you want to build the binary yourself for other reasons,
you can follow these steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jagoe/haste-client-go.git        # clone this repo
cd haste-client-go
[GOARCH=<your architecture>] [GOOS=<your OS>] make build  # build client
sudo mv ./bin/haste /usr/local/bin/haste                  # move to a bin directory in your PATH
```
